Tie-Amazon-S3

This module simply makes an Amazon S3 bucket behave as though it were a
regular Perl hash.  It makes use of Net::Amazon::S3 to do its magic.


INSTALLATION

To install this module, run the following commands:

	perl Makefile.PL
	make
	make test
	make install

TESTING

To run `make test' of this module against Amazon S3 itself, you will
need to define the AMAZON_S3_EXPENSIVE_TESTS environment variable, as
well as set the variables AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID, AWS_ACCESS_KEY_SECRET, and
AWS_ACCESS_S3_BUCKET to their corresponding values (your access id,
secret key, and bucket to put test files in.)  Furthermore, the bucket
to be used must exist prior to testing.

After installing, you can find documentation for this module with the
