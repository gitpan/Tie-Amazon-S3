        Now implementing FIRSTKEY, NEXTKEY, and SCALAR, fulfilling hash
        iteration.  Changed the underlying abstraction a bit to use an
        intermediate hash to hold the bucket keys and coderefs to
        getting the corresponding values.

        First version, featuring much what can be done with hashes.
        Need to implement FIRSTKEY, NEXTKEY, SCALAR, UNTIE, and possibly
        DESTROY.
