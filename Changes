        Now implementing FIRSTKEY, NEXTKEY, and SCALAR, fulfilling hash
        iteration.  Changed the underlying abstraction a bit to use an
        intermediate hash to hold the bucket keys and coderefs to
        getting the corresponding values.

0.01    2007-12-12/19:51 +0800
        First version, featuring much what can be done with hashes.
        Need to implement FIRSTKEY, NEXTKEY, SCALAR, UNTIE, and possibly
        DESTROY.
